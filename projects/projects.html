  			In an attempt to learn more about networking, queue structures, and multi-threading, I had a shot at creating a simple "chat room" program using Python with
  			the "sockets", "threading", and "queue" libraries. I will admit I didn't initially intend on learning about multi-threading and queues but realised <i>very</i>
  			early on that they were concepts that had to be tackled to create the program and so here I am.

  			What do you get when you combine procrastination and a free period? Failing your A-Levels. However, you also get a 20 or so line script written using the PIL
        (Python Image Library) that converts any given image (provided it is a type supported by PIL) into a text file of a customisable size.
        Fun? I suppose. Interesting? To an extent. Pointless? Definitely. Hotel? Trivago.

        Now for a practical application of my programming skills (if you could even call them skills; more like an overly-large collection of happy little accidents that happen to make something even remotely useful).
        Using the tkinter libraries for the GUI and the pygame library for generating the colour-picker itself, I made a program that allows you to find a colour, pick it, and get its RGB and hex value.
        However, as it is made using some rather <i>interesting</i> methods, it doesn't like running on any OS other than Windows.
