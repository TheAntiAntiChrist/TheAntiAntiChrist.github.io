      Welcome. This is my (a.k.a rev-57's a.k.a Oscar's) website (or rather, my online portfolio with potentially some other things mixed in).
      Here you can see all of the projects I have made and/or am currently working on (or at least the ones that work well enough to upload to my Github).

      If you were wondering why the name, it's simply a shortening of my guitar model - Revelation RST-57.
      It was the first thing to my right when thinking of a name, okay? I'm a programmer, not a writer.

      Incase you're still wondering who I am at all, let me <i>properly</i> introduce myself.
      Hello, my name is Oscar (or Oz if you're feeling a tad adventurous) and I am currently an A-Level student studying chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics.
      I plan on furthering my studies in computer science at university and hope on delving more into cyber-security and software engineering.
    </p>
    <p id="p4">
      If you couldn't tell already, I like computers.
    </p>
    <p id="p5">
      On top of my obsession with all things technical, I am also a lover of most things musical (hence the guitar-inspired name).
      Synths, guitars - electric or acoustic, piano, pedals (let's not talk about the increasing collection I own).
      Oh, and obviously the music itself.
    </p>
